    "### Q. Why Dart? What Makes Dart Special? Why Did Google Choose Dart for Flutter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dart has two main components:\n",
    "- **Dart Web**\n",
    "- **Dart Native**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dart Native** can compile your code to fit different architectures. It supports both **Just-In-Time (JIT)** and **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)** compilation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **AOT Compilation:**\n",
    "- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)**: Compiles code before execution and distributes the resulting binary.\n",
    "- Compiling for architecture takes a lot of time because it involves translating the high-level code into machine code optimized for specific hardware. This ensures the best possible performance on the target devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **JIT Compilation:**\n",
    "- **Just-In-Time (JIT)**: Uses the DartVM to provide a fast development cycle, meaning you can see the results of your changes almost immediately.\n",
    "- JIT allows quick feedback during development, which is essential for mobile development.\n",
    "  - On developer mode, your code runs on a virtual machine, which might slow down execution but allows for rapid iteration.\n",
    "  - Once development stabilizes, you can switch to the AOT compiler for optimized performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Null Safety:**\n",
    "- Values can't be null unless explicitly stated, enhancing code reliability and reducing runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Google's Development**: Both Dart and Flutter are developed by Google, allowing for seamless modifications to the language to enhance the platform.\n",
    "2. **JIT and AOT Compilation**: Dart Native provides both JIT and AOT compilers, combining fast development cycles with optimized performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compilation Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Compiles code before execution for optimized performance on specific hardware.\n",
    "   - **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: Uses DartVM for a fast development cycle, allowing immediate feedback and quick iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Null Safety**: Dart ensures values can't be null unless explicitly allowed, which enhances code reliability and minimizes runtime errors.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Development Cycle**:\n",
    "   - **JIT in Development Mode**: Provides rapid feedback during development despite slower execution.\n",
    "   - **AOT for Production**: Switches to AOT compilation for better performance once development stabilizes.\n",

    "### 1. `var` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Dart allows you to declare variables using the `var` keyword. The Dart compiler infers the type of the variable based on the assigned value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Here's an example of using the `var` keyword and updating variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "    var name = \"Minho\"; // Dart infers that 'name' is a String\n",
    "    name = \"minho\"; // Updating the variable with another String value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    String lastname = \"Song\"; // Explicitly specifying the type\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `var` Inside Functions and Methods**: When working with *local variables inside functions and methods*, the `var` keyword is commonly used.\n",
    "- **Specify Type Inside Classes**: When working with variables *inside classes*, it's a convention to specify the type explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables can be updated later, but the new value must match the original type inferred or specified.\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    String firstName;\n",
    "    String lastName;\n",
    "\n",
    "    Person(this.firstName, this.lastName);\n",

    "### 2. `dynamic` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview:\n",
    "- A `dynamic` variable can hold values of multiple types.\n",
    "- While not recommended for regular use, it can be useful and sometimes necessary in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Here's an example of using the `dynamic` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  var name;\n",
    "  name = \"minho\";\n",
    "  name = 12;\n",
    "  name = true; // The variable type is dynamic\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, you can explicitly declare a variable as `dynamic`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  dynamic name; \n",
    "  if (name is String) {\n",
    "    name.endsWith('o'); // Now that the string type is checked, the variable can use string methods\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Variables**: When a variable is declared as `dynamic`, it can hold values of any type, and its type can change at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Using `dynamic` can lead to runtime errors if the variable is used in ways incompatible with its current type. It is less safe compared to using specific types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protected Variable**: When a variable is declared as `dynamic`, it means that the variable is flexible and its type is not fixed. This flexibility is sometimes referred to as \"protected\" in the sense that it can adapt to different types. However, this can also be a source of errors if not handled carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: `dynamic` should be used only when absolutely required, such as when dealing with APIs or third-party libraries where the type of data is not known beforehand.\n",

    "### 3. Nullable Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Null safety helps developers avoid referencing null values in the code, which can cause runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example without Null Safety:\n",
    "Without null safety, referencing a null value can cause runtime errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "// without null safety\n",
    "bool isEmpty(String string) => string.length == 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "    isEmpty(null);\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Runtime error happens because null type does not have a 'length' method\n",
    "```\n",
    "This error will occur on the user's side, as the compiler cannot catch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Null Safety:\n",
    "You must be explicit if a variable can be null.\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  String? name = 'Minho'; // Declare a nullable String variable\n",
    "  name = null; // Assigning null to the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Uncommenting the following line will cause a compile-time error\n",
    "  // because 'name' might be null\n",
    "  // name.isNotEmpty; \n",
    "\n",
    "  // To safely use 'name', check if it's not null\n",
    "  if (name != null) {\n",
    "    print(name.isNotEmpty); // This is safe because 'name' is not null\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nullable Variables**: By adding `?` at the end of the type, you can indicate that the variable can be null.\n",
    "- **Non-Nullable by Default**: By default, all variables are non-nullable.\n",
    "- **Null Safety**: Adding `?` lets Dart know that the variable can be null, and helps avoid null reference errors.\n",

    "### 4. `final` Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dart, you can use `final` to create variables that cannot be modified after they are initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Mutable Variable:\n",
    "Using `var` or a specific data type allows the variable to be updated and modified throughout the program:\n",

    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  var name = 'Minho';\n",
    "  name = 'Song'; // The variable can be updated\n",
    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  final name = 'Minho';\n",
    "  // name = 'Song'; // This will cause a compile-time error\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability**: `final` ensures that the variable's value cannot be changed once it is set.\n",
    "- **Run-time Initialization**: `final` variables can be assigned values that are determined at runtime.\n",

    "### 5. `late` Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The `late` keyword can be added before `final` or `var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  late final String name;\n",
    "  // Perform some operations, fetch data from an API\n",
    "  name = 'Minho';\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Usage:\n",
    "You create a variable without an initial value and later assign data to it, for example, from an API. The `late` keyword allows you to create a variable first and assign data to it later.\n",
    "**Example with Deferred Initialization:**\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  late final String name;\n",
    "  // Perform some operations, fetch data from an API\n",
    "  print(name); // Dart will notify you that you should not access the variable before data is assigned.\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deferred Initialization**: `late` allows you to declare a variable without initializing it immediately. You can assign a value to it later in the program.\n",
    "- **Null Safety**: This feature is part of Dart's null safety system. It ensures that the variable is not accessed before it has been initialized.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful when working with data fetching, APIs, or other scenarios where the data is not immediately available at the time of variable declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flutter, `late` is particularly helpful for scenarios like API data fetching, where you need to declare variables that will be assigned values once the data is available.\n"

    "### 6. `const` Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The `const` keyword in Dart is different from `const` in JavaScript or TypeScript. In JavaScript or TypeScript, `const` works like `final` in Dart, meaning the value cannot be changed once set. However, in Dart, `const` creates compile-time constants, which behave like `final`, but their value must be known at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Compile-Time Constant:\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  const API_KEY = 'asdfasdf112';\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",

    "  // This is not a compile-time constant because the compiler doesn't know the value of API_KEY at compile time.\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compile-Time Constants**: Use `const` for values that are fixed and known at compile time.\n",
    "- **Final or Var for Run-Time Values**: If the value comes from an API, user input, or any other run-time data, the variable should be `final` or `var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with Compile-Time Value:**\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "  const maxAllowedPrice = 120;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compile-Time Constant**: `const` is used to create constants whose values are known at compile time.\n",
    "- **Immutable**: Just like `final`, `const` ensures that the value cannot be changed once it is set.\n",

    "### 1. Defining a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dart, functions can be defined to perform specific tasks. Depending on whether the function returns a value or not, you can specify the return type or use `void` to indicate no return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Void Function:\n",
    "`void` indicates that the function does not return anything but performs an action such as printing something.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "void sayHello(String name) {\n",
    "  print(\"Hello $name, nice to meet you\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Function with Return Type:\n",
    "If the function returns a value, specify the return type at the beginning of the function.\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "String sayHello(String name) {\n",
    "  return \"Hello $name, nice to meet you\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fast Arrow Syntax:\n",
    "For simple functions that return a value immediately, Dart provides a concise syntax known as the `fast arrow syntax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "String sayHello1(String name) => \"Hello $name, nice to meet you\";\n",
    "num plus(num a, num b) => a + b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The fast arrow syntax (`=>`) is used when the function consists of a single expression that returns a value.\n",
    "*   It provides a shorter and more readable way to define simple functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. Named Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a function requires multiple arguments, relying on the order of those arguments can be confusing and error-prone, as the positions of the arguments are arbitrary. \n",
    "- To address this, `named parameters` can be used. \n",
    "- Named parameters enable you to specify the names of the arguments in the function call. \n",
    "- To define named parameters, use curly brackets `{}` in the parameter list of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with Named Parameters:\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "String sayHello({String name, int age, String country}) {\n",

    "    country: 'Korea',\n",
    "    name: 'Minho',\n",
    "  ));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using named parameters, you don't have to maintain a specific order for the arguments; you simply specify each argument by its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The example above causes a red-line because of null safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Default Values for Named Parameters:\n",
    "Dart enforces null safety, which means the provided arguments may need to be non-null. To handle this, you can set default values for named parameters.\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "String sayHello({\n",
    "  String name = 'anon',\n",
    "  int age = 12,\n",
    "  String country = 'Wakanda',\n",
    "}) {\n",
    "  return \"Hello $name, you are $age, and you are from $country\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Required Named Parameters:\n",
    "If you require specific data and default values are not suitable, you can use the required modifier. This ensures that the user must provide these arguments.\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "String sayHello({\n",
    "  required String name,\n",
    "  required int age,\n",
    "  required String country,\n",
    "}) {\n",
    "  return \"Hello $name, you are $age, and you are from $country\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Named Parameters**: Use curly brackets`{}` in the parameter list to enable named parameters.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Named parameters allow you to specify arguments in any order.\n",
    "- **Default Values**: Set default values for named parameters to handle null safety.\n",

    "#### 1. Specifying Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create a class, you must specify the type of each variable. \n",
    "- This ensures type safety and helps the Dart compiler catch potential errors.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Cascade Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cascade notation, denoted by `..`, allows you to perform a sequence of operations on the same object. This can make your code more concise and readable by chaining multiple operations on a single object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax Explanation:\n",
    "- Use `..` to chain multiple operations on the same object.\n",
    "- Each operation is performed on the same instance, and the final result is the instance itself.\n",
    "- The entire cascade expression should end with a semicolon (`;`).\n",

    "### 4. Enums\n",
    "\n",
    "Enums are a special type in Dart that allows you to define a collection of named constants. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Enums?\n",
    "- Enums are a way to define a set of named values, known as members.\n",
    "- Each member of an enum is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Using Enums:\n",
    "- **`Type Safety`**: Enums enforce type safety by restricting the values a variable can take, `preventing invalid values from being assigned`.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Using enums makes your code easier to maintain, as you can change the enum values in one place without affecting other parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Here's an example of how to define and use enums in Dart:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
